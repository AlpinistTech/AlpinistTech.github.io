      <h3>Lab 0</h3>
      <p>
        This Lab focuses on setting up a development environment using Ubuntu 22.04 as a Virtual machine.
        The main focus was to install essential software such as apache web server, Git and necessary tools for the web development.
        The Lab covers working with Github repositories where we work on cloning, editing, committing and pushing changes.
        The purpose of this lab is to prepare a solid foundation for web application programming and hacking activities throughout the course.

      <h3>Lab 1</h3>
      <p>
        Overview:<br />
        Lab 1 focused on foundational concepts of the web specifically the HTTP protocol and basic web application programming.
        It was divided into two main parts:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Web and HTTP Protocol</b><br />
          Hands-on activities involved using Wireshark to capture and analyze HTTP traffic and Telnet to manually send HTTP requests.
          This section aimed to thoroughly understand how HTTP requests and responses work at the packet level.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Basic web application programming</b><br />
          Introducing web application development using CGI with C programming and basics of PHP for developing simple web applications that handle user input.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="lab2">
      <h3>Lab 2</h3>
      <p>
        Overview:<br />
        In Lab 2, the lecture introduced front-end web development using HTML and JavaScript.
        It includes concepts, hands-on exercises, and a lab focused on creating a simple dynamic webpage.
        Key topics covered:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Basic HTML tags to create and deploy simple static HTML pages.</li>
        <li>Adding images and forms with GET and POST methods.</li>
        <li>Introduction to client-side JavaScript and its role in dynamic web pages, including inline JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Hands-on experience with Lab 2.1 and Lab 2.2.</li>
      </ol>

    <section id="hackathon1">
      <h3>Hackathon 1</h3>
      <p>
        In this hackathon, I explored multiple levels of reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on a simulated vulnerable web application,
        followed by implementing defense mechanisms through input validation and output encoding.
        This hands-on experience increased my understanding of both exploiting and mitigating XSS vulnerabilities.
        Key outcomes included successful script injections displaying my name with alert(), identifying vulnerable backend PHP code,
        and applying proper data sanitization to secure the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        This hackathon highlighted the importance of secure coding practices, especially in handling untrusted inputs.
        By performing real XSS attacks and then fixing the vulnerabilities, I better understood how small oversights can lead to major security breaches.
        Techniques like <code>htmlentities()</code> in PHP and frontend validation/encoding strengthened the security posture of the app.

      <h3>Individual Project 1</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- You can add your own detailed description here. Example: -->
        This individual project involves designing and implementing a secure and functional web application that demonstrates key skills learned throughout the course.
        It integrates concepts from labs and hackathons, including secure coding, front-end development, and back-end integration.
        The project showcases my understanding of web technologies, security best practices, and real-world application development.
